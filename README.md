# GREENLIGHT

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: Greenlight Financial

* When was the company incorporated? 
    * The company was founded in 2014

* Who are the founders of the company?
    * Timothy Sheehan 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    * The founder of the company has children of his own and was struck by the fact that there wasn't a good solution available for him to give his kids access to money in a controlled manner for everyday spending.
    * He worried about the use of cash, since it could get lost and also because he could not eaisly track where his children were spending their money.
    * Lastly, he felt there were other key features/capabilities that were important to raising financially literate and independent children.
    * Ultimately, he (and other competitors that that i'll introduce in this segment) recognized that financial needs change and evolve with each lifestage, particularly for pre-teens and teenagers. 
        * Pre-teens (8-12): need to learn about about money management, setting goals, the value of money, and giving to others
        * Teenagers (13-17): are becoming more independent, able to work, make more financial decisions, and begin to work
    * Therefore, spending, saving, earning, borrowing, and giving are at the top of the list of financial needs to be addressed.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    * The company has 14 investors, including 2 lead investors (i.e., Relay Ventures, TTV Capital) and 12 others (e.g., SunTrust Bank, Ally Financial, Synchrony Financial)
    * They have raised $66.6M over 3 rounds venture capital
    * As of February 2018, Greenlight has a $50-100M valuation, according to PrivCo


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    * Strategically, Greenlight aims to help parents raise financially-smart kids. Tactically, they are solving a well-known problem parents have which is providing their kids with money for a specific purpose when they need it (e.g., school lunch money, field-trips)
    * Greenlight essentially offers a pre-paid debit card for kids, teens, and college students that parents manage from their mobile phones, using flexible parental controls. 
    * Parents can give money, manage chores, and pay allowances to their children and can choose the exact stores where their kids can spend and how much money they can spend.
    * Greenlight also includes an innovative Educational Savings Account that enables parents to set a Parent-Paid Savings Interest Rate to help teach their kids the importance of saving. 
    * Key Features:

* Who is the company's intended customer? 
    * Greenlight is primarily targeting Mass-Affluent parents, though it does also do minor targeting to children aged 13+. Teens can initiate opening a Greenlight account, which is ultimately approved and funded by the parent. 
    * Their competitors are targeting clients further down market, even proclaiming not just to provide an offering for parents/minors but for the under-banked.

* Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    * Market size could not be determined.   
    * However, in March 2018, Greenlight Financial announced crossing 100,000 customers, growing its customer base 300% since their investment from Amazon.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    * Traditional retails banks (e.g., Chase, Wells Fargo) offer checking accounts for minors that are co-owned by a parent. These accounts are often paired with debit cards, but lack robust digital capabilities needed by parents and minors (e.g., parental controls, allowance for chores) 
    * There has been an increase in FinTech start-ups attempting to solve a similar challenge (e.g., Current, GoHenry), but they also attempt to solve financial needs of a variety of users and segments ultimately missing some of the bells and whistles that Greenlight has built
    * Overall, Greenlight provides a leading offering for the following reasons:
        * Superior UX / UI
        * Robust parental controls (e.g., store level controls, including specific store locations)
        * No minimum age limits
        * Support for co-parenting
        * Reasonable price point
        * No transfer fees
        * Real-time in-app approval request for parents
        * No need to open a separate bank account, Greenlight is equipped with instant bank account verification 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    * The company does not publish their technology architecture or provide open APIs for integration. 


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    * Retail Banking and Wealth Management 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    * Over the last 5 years there has been a substantial uptick in the number of FinTech competitors in this space
    * These FinTechs have very quickly built a decent set of  capabilities that provide transparency and control to parents/guardians.
    * Although most have started as standalone offerings, there are rumblings of buy-outs or partnerships with more traditional banks. 
    * Some are looking for sale (e.g., Rego), while others seem to be looking for more of a partnership route (e.g., Greenlight)

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
    * Current
    * Go Henry
    * Akimbo
    * GoalSetter
    * Rego
    * Step


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    * This company has 4 patents pending for their proprietary parental controls. 
    * They could potentially corner the market for role-based entitlements, that could not only apply to parents but also care-givers to seniors.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? 
    * Number of Greenlight Accounts opened, broken down by: 
        * Direct to consumer vs. via partnerships
        * Child initiated vs. parent-initiated
    * Number of pre-praid debit cards ordered per family
    * Balances held in parents accounts and wallets associated with each child
    * Total revenue, broken down by their 2 revenue streams:
        * subscription fee
        * debit card interchange rate
    * Number of Greenlight app downloads, broken down by both parent and child users

* How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
    * Informatio is not publicly available to assess the above metrics, since Greenlight is a privately-held company.
    * In December 2017, Amazon’s Alexa Fund participated in a $16M Series A to Greenlight Financial, an alternative debit card issuer aimed at young consumers. With the card, parents can manage spending limits and allocate funds for their children through a mobile app. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    * Greenlight is leading in the market, based on online testimonials from testimonals and press they are receiving (e.g., CNBC, USA Today, Tech Crunch)
    * Additionally, while no plans have been announced, Amazon Cash could look to integrate Greenlight Financial’s card into the allowance product to expand to locations where kids can use their Amazon Allowance (and ideally include the growing number of offline brick-and-mortar retailers that accept Amazon Cash as payment). A partnership of this size could make Greenlight a household name.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 
    * Additional Features/Capabilities for Existing Product:
        * Digital Debit Card: Given the extensive adoption of Google and Apply Pay, I'm not sure how much longer physical cards will even be around.
        * Borrow Money Feature: Allow children to request to borrow money from their parents, either with an interest rate set by the parent or without that must be paid back within a certain time period.
        * Person to Person Payments: Perhaps integrating/partnering with Zelle or Venmo to offer the feature. This will be of particular interest to teens (e.g., dinners, movies)
        * Mobile Check Deposit Capture: Ability to deposit a check digitally is a table stakes feature (e.g., checks from birthdays and other life events)
        * Overdraft: Offer an unsecured overdraft feature, similar to traditional retail banks in the event that children really need to access funds. The feature could be supported by parental approval.
        * Referral Feature: Allow children or parents to send referrals and provide a small incentive offer (e.g., cash, interest, free month of subscription)
    * Leveraging Existing Infrastructure to Support New Segments: Many of the Greenlight control and transparency features would also be valuable to seniors and their caregivers. Given the ageing population in the US, consider leveraging existing features with slight tailoring to service this market.


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    * Greenlight is already offering a robust set of features, but the FinTech landscape is competitive and evolving rapidly.
    * They need to close gaps on features that traditional banks offer (e.g., mobile check deposit) to make switching to their solution easier. 
    * New features should be considered to ensure Greenlight continues to be the market leader.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 
    * Open APIs: To allow for ease of new integrations 
    * Voice Assistants: Integration with Alexa and Google Home to initiate/approve transactions or to request information
    

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    * Offering Open APIs would allow other Banks/FinTechs to more easily integrate the Greenlight offering, therefore increasing accounts opened, balances captured, and ultimately overall revenue. It would also reduce time and effort spent to support integrations vs. development of net new features and capabilities.
    * Enabling key commands through voice assistants would increase adoption and engagement of the product and capabilities. Thereby, increasing overall revenue.
